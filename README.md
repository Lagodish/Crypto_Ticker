# Crypto Ticker

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* Install Arduino IDE
* Install [ESP32 Hardware drivers](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp32-thing-hookup-guide/installing-the-esp32-arduino-core) for arduino

### Dependencies 

* [SSD1306 Driver](https://github.com/ThingPulse/esp8266-oled-ssd1306)


```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### Issues

* Uploading code to board sometimes fails. Change the serial upload speed from 921600 to 460800

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
